# ðŸ§¬ Immune Defense
Control the bodyâ€™s last line of defense in this microscopic tower defense game!
## About the Game

Immune Defense is a colorful 2D tower defense game where you play as the bodyâ€™s immune system, protecting it from waves of invading bacteria, viruses.

Youâ€™ll place powerful immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and T-cells along the bloodstream to stop infections from spreading.
## Gameplay

- Enemies travel through blood vessels in waves.

- Place immune cells on strategic locations to destroy them.

- Each defeated enemy drops Antigens, the gameâ€™s currency.

- Use Antigens to build and upgrade your immune defense. 

The game features a bright, cartoon-style visual aesthetic inspired by the microscopic world.
## Note

This game was created in 10 days for GameJam 2025, so it's still an early prototype.
Currently, it includes only 3 playable levels, with core mechanics in place â€” but polish, balancing, and additional content are planned in the future.
